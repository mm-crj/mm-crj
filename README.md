# Hi Welcome to my Github Profile
BioMath Researcher at TU Dresden. I models of tissue growth with partial differential equations. I use finite volume methods and unstructured meshes to model tissue with irregular boundaries. These schemes conserve mass, and also preserve structural properties like gradient flow and decay of free energy. Apart form that I am also passionate about Opensource projects like:

* Mozilla Common Voice
* Neovim
* [Quantitative modelling]()
* Natural Language processing in Bangla
* [Digitising Old books]()
